;; # Functions for interactive use of natural deduction in the REPL

;; To use lwb for natural deduction, one proceeds as follows:

;; - Load a logic with `(load-logic logic)`
;; - Create a new proof with `(proof premises conclusion)` 
;; - Prove the conclusion form the promises by
;;      - forward steps `(step-f ...)`
;;      - backward steps `(step-b ...)` 
;;      - unifying symbols `(unify ...)`
